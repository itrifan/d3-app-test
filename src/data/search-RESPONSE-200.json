Through the agreement, Praescient is now able to provide new and existing customers with access to Siren’s investigative platform.\n\nDeveloped as a spinout from big data and knowledge representation research, Siren provides a unique combination of search, business intelligence, big data, link analysis and knowledge representation which advances the way organizations address data driven problems.\n\nKatie Crotty, CEO of Praescient Analytics, said: “Siren is an evolution in regard to the next phase of traditional intelligence platforms. It provides organizations with the tools to understand and leverage how critical data is interconnected in real-time, merging functionalities that were previously disconnected.”\n\nThe Siren platform will be integrated into Praescient’s Advanced Analytics Solution (A2S). A2S is an adaptable intelligence solution purposefully designed with the intelligence analyst in mind, leveraging an open, extensible architecture built with IBM i2 Enterprise Insight Analysis at its center. It provides multi-dimensional visual analysis and advanced analytics to create mission critical insight and data in real-time.\n\nA2S’s key capabilities include supporting operations in connected & disconnected environments; automated text analytics; geo-spatial analysis; automatic report generation; ad-hoc data imports; analyst collaboration; advanced tooling for external data access; data replication and sub-setting.\n\nA2S has been developed as a result of more than two decades of experience with more than 1,200 military organizations in 130 countries. Its customers include all the members of the US Intelligence Community, all branches of the US Department of Defense, and all major US federal agencies.\n\nSiren is primarily aimed at investigative functions within organizations (cyber threat intelligence, financial crime, law enforcement) where citizen data scientists have the real need for advanced “correlation” analysis on multiple datasets at the same time.\n\nJohn Randles, CEO of Siren, said: “The partnership with Praescient opens up an array of opportunities for us in the US Federal space. Praescient provides us with a larger geographical presence and invaluable domain expertise. They are charismatic technologists who speak the language of our clients.”\n\nCrotty concluded: “We are excited to partner with such an innovative, groundbreaking platform within the data analytics space. Siren will be a vital solution to many of our clients’ intelligence and investigative requirements. Not only does it resolve their immediate needs, but it catapults them into anticipating and solving future challenges.”'",

Ian made landfall Sept. 28 with 150 mph sustained winds as a strong Category 4 hurricane, and caused major flooding, damage, destruction and unfortunately, even loss of life. Fremin sits on the community board for a barrier island in SW Florida, where he is closely and personally connected. He shares with us first-hand accounts of the damages in the area, the challenges barrier islands faced right after the hurricane and stories of the local community coming together in the wake of destruction. Fremin also talks about how he helped from afar when he couldn’t yet access North Captiva Island, and how others around the country can do the same. Below are links to various organizations and donation sites to help recovery and relief efforts in Southwest Florida:",

Through the agreement, Praescient is now able to provide new and existing customers with access to Siren’s investigative platform.\n\nDeveloped as a spinout from big data and knowledge representation research, Siren provides a unique combination of search, business intelligence, big data, link analysis and knowledge representation which advances the way organizations address data driven problems.\n\nKatie Crotty, CEO of Praescient Analytics, said: “Siren is an evolution in regard to the next phase of traditional intelligence platforms. It provides organizations with the tools to understand and leverage how critical data is interconnected in real-time, merging functionalities that were previously disconnected.”\n\nThe Siren platform will be integrated into Praescient’s Advanced Analytics Solution (A2S). A2S is an adaptable intelligence solution purposefully designed with the intelligence analyst in mind, leveraging an open, extensible architecture built with IBM i2 Enterprise Insight Analysis at its center. It provides multi-dimensional visual analysis and advanced analytics to create mission critical insight and data in real-time.\n\nA2S’s key capabilities include supporting operations in connected & disconnected environments; automated text analytics; geo-spatial analysis; automatic report generation; ad-hoc data imports; analyst collaboration; advanced tooling for external data access; data replication and sub-setting.\n\nA2S has been developed as a result of more than two decades of experience with more than 1,200 military organizations in 130 countries. Its customers include all the members of the US Intelligence Community, all branches of the US Department of Defense, and all major US federal agencies.\n\nSiren is primarily aimed at investigative functions within organizations (cyber threat intelligence, financial crime, law enforcement) where citizen data scientists have the real need for advanced “correlation” analysis on multiple datasets at the same time.\n\nJohn Randles, CEO of Siren, said: “The partnership with Praescient opens up an array of opportunities for us in the US Federal space. Praescient provides us with a larger geographical presence and invaluable domain expertise. They are charismatic technologists who speak the language of our clients.”\n\nCrotty concluded: “We are excited to partner with such an innovative, groundbreaking platform within the data analytics space. Siren will be a vital solution to many of our clients’ intelligence and investigative requirements. Not only does it resolve their immediate needs, but it catapults them into anticipating and solving future challenges.”'",

Ian made landfall Sept. 28 with 150 mph sustained winds as a strong Category 4 hurricane, and caused major flooding, damage, destruction and unfortunately, even loss of life. Fremin sits on the community board for a barrier island in SW Florida, where he is closely and personally connected. He shares with us first-hand accounts of the damages in the area, the challenges barrier islands faced right after the hurricane and stories of the local community coming together in the wake of destruction. Fremin also talks about how he helped from afar when he couldn’t yet access North Captiva Island, and how others around the country can do the same. Below are links to various organizations and donation sites to help recovery and relief efforts in Southwest Florida:",
